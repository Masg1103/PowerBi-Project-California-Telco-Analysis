## Understanding Why Customers Leave: A Look at Customer Churn at California Telco Network
This Power BI project dives into a common challenge faced by many telecommunication providers: keeping customers happy and preventing them from switching to competitors (customer churn).

This project utilizes two key datasets collected from our telecom operations to understand customer behavior, service utilization, and churn dynamics:

**1. Telecom Customer Churn Dataset:**
This comprehensive dataset provides a detailed view of our customer base, capturing various aspects of customer engagement and subscription details. Key attributes include:

**Customer ID and Demographics:** Unique identifiers for each customer along with basic demographic information such as age, gender, and marital status.
- Service Subscription Details: Data on the type of services subscribed, such as phone service, multiple lines, internet service, and types of internet (DSL, Fiber Optic, Cable).
- Usage Metrics: Includes average monthly long-distance charges, average monthly GB downloads, and subscription to additional services like online security, device protection, and streaming services.
- Billing and Charges: Monthly charges, total charges, and refunds, as well as extra data charges and long-distance charges, providing a financial perspective on customer engagements.
- Customer Status: Current status of the customer (Churned, Stayed, or Joined) along with churn reasons where applicable, offering insights into customer retention and attrition.

**2. Population Data by Zip Code:**
This dataset enriches our analysis by integrating demographic and geographical insights based on the customer's zip code. It includes:

- Zip Code: The primary postal division in which the customers reside.
- Population: The total population within each zip code, offering a demographic context that helps in analyzing market penetration and service distribution.

**Introduction**
California Telco Network, a fictional company used in this analysis, strives to deliver excellent service and keep its customers satisfied.  However, customer churn can hurt the company's bottom line and limit its growth. It can also be a sign of deeper problems, like poor customer service or strong competition.

This project uses data analysis to uncover the reasons why customers leave California Telco Network.  We look at things like customer demographics, how they use their services, and what kind of feedback they provide.  By understanding these patterns, we can identify specific factors that lead to churn.

The goal is to give California Telco Network valuable insights to reduce churn and build stronger customer relationships.  This could involve creating targeted programs to address customer needs and keep them engaged with the company.  By taking these steps, California Telco Network can ensure its long-term success in the competitive telecom industry.

Please note: California Telco Network is fictional and created for this specific exercise.
