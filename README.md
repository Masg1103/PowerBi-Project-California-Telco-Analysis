# PowerBi-Project-California-Telco-Analysis

**Introduction to the Datasets**
This report utilizes two key datasets collected from our telecom operations to understand customer behavior, service utilization, and churn dynamics:

**1. Telecom Customer Churn Dataset:**
This comprehensive dataset provides a detailed view of our customer base, capturing various aspects of customer engagement and subscription details. Key attributes include:

**Customer ID and Demographics:** Unique identifiers for each customer along with basic demographic information such as age, gender, and marital status.
- Service Subscription Details: Data on the type of services subscribed, such as phone service, multiple lines, internet service, and types of internet (DSL, Fiber Optic, Cable).
- Usage Metrics: Includes average monthly long-distance charges, average monthly GB downloads, and subscription to additional services like online security, device protection, and streaming services.
- Billing and Charges: Monthly charges, total charges, and refunds, as well as extra data charges and long-distance charges, providing a financial perspective on customer engagements.
- Customer Status: Current status of the customer (Churned, Stayed, or Joined) along with churn reasons where applicable, offering insights into customer retention and attrition.

**2. Population Data by Zip Code:**
This dataset enriches our analysis by integrating demographic and geographical insights based on the customer's zip code. It includes:

- Zip Code: The primary postal division in which the customers reside.
- Population: The total population within each zip code, offering a demographic context that helps in analyzing market penetration and service distribution.

**Purpose of Analysis:**
The integration of these datasets in our Power BI report aims to uncover patterns and trends in customer churn, identify demographic and service-related factors influencing customer retention, and ultimately guide strategic decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn rates.
